    <h1 id="Barack">Barack Obama</h1>
    <p id="section1">Obama was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii, two years after the territory
       was admitted to the Union as the 50th state. Raised largely in Hawaii, he
        also spent one year of his childhood in Washington state and four years
        in Indonesia. After graduating from Columbia University in 1983, he
        worked as a community organizer in Chicago. In 1988, he enrolled in
        Harvard Law School, where he was the first black president of the
        Harvard Law Review. After graduating, he became a civil rights attorney
        and a professor, teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago
        Law School from 1992 to 2004. He represented the 13th district for three
        terms in the Illinois Senate from 1997 to 2004, when he ran for the U.S
        . Senate. He received national attention in 2004 with his unexpected
        March primary win, his well-received July Democratic National Convention
        keynote address, and his landslide November election to the Senate.
        In 2008, he was nominated for president a year after his campaign began
        and after a close primary campaign against Hillary Clinton. He was elected over
        Republican John McCain and was inaugurated on January 20, 2009. Nine months later,
        he was named the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, accepting the award with
        the caveat that he felt there were others "far more deserving of this honor than I."</p>

        <p id="section2">During his first two years in office, Obama signed many
          landmark bills into law. The main reforms were the Patient Protection
          and Affordable Care Act (often referred to as "Obamacare", shortened
          as the "Affordable Care Act"), the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and
          Consumer Protection Act, and the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of
          2010. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Tax
          Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act
          of 2010 served as economic stimulus amidst the Great Recession. After
          a lengthy debate over the national debt limit, he signed the Budget
          Control and the American Taxpayer Relief Acts. In foreign policy, he
          increased U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan, reduced nuclear weapons
          with the United States–Russia New START treaty, and ended military
          involvement in the Iraq War. He ordered military involvement in Libya
          in opposition to Muammar Gaddafi; Gaddafi was killed by NATO-assisted
          forces, and he also ordered the military operation that resulted in
          the deaths of Osama bin Laden and suspected Yemeni Al-Qaeda operative
          Anwar al-Awlaki.</p>
